        This Year’s Theme: "Psychogeography is..."
        <br />
        This year’s 4th World Congress of Psychogeography theme is an acknowledgement that psychogeography can no longer (if it ever could) be confined within narrow boundaries of definition. Who does psychogeography, where, for what motivation or intention, and with what medium of expression, is now wide open. How you choose to define Psychogeography is your choice - the Selection Panel will be swayed by the persuasiveness with which you present your case.
        <br /><br />
        This year’s Congress will adopt a different hub each day:<br />

        Friday – Heritage Quay, the University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield<br />
        Saturday – in and around Empire House, Dewsbury town centre<br />
        Sunday – the Pennine village of Marsden<br />

        <br />

        <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/YXDFPX7">Open Call For Proposals Form</a>. The call ends 28th May 2019.
