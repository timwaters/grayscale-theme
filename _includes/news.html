      <h3>COVID UPDATE- The 4th World Congress 2020, 4th 5th & 6th September 2020</h3>
      <p>
          Covid-19 has made a dogged effort to stop us in our tracks but we hope, with a few nifty body swerves, to keep 
          moving and maybe even to find new pathways and insights from it. The big point to note is that 
          this year <strong>we will be offering a virtual Congress; there will be no physical gathering of people</strong> in Huddersfield, 
          or anywhere else, this year.
      </p>
      <h3>Call for proposals </h3>
        <p>
            This year's theme will be: <strong>"Walk, Don't Walk"</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We suspect that the period of confinement has, for most people, been a profound experience. And obliged almost all of us to alter our
            relationship with time and space. Enforced leisure and heightened vigilance has opened new vistas to many. People have listened to birdsong
            for the first time, or ventured down a strange footpath, noticed mysterious markings on an old building or simply remarked upon the quality of
            the air.
        </p>
        <p>
            As restrictions loosen and we return to old patterns, much of this sensibility will be re-submerged, but surely vestiges will remain to
            define whatever becomes the 'new normal'. Our theme "Walk, Don't Walk" expresses that central paradox.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year's congress will be a space for you to express your own take on that. Please send us your suggestions for events you would like
            to present in the programme.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are looking for submissions which can be delivered on-line...  But we don't want the Congress to become a 3 day Zoom webinar.
            We welcome submissions which explore other approaches, for example: the possibility of physical activity within social-distancing,
            film screenings, audio only...
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the Congress will be despatialised, it can take place in any time zone of the world during those 72 hours of the long weekend,
            so we welcome international submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be a two-stage selection process. An <strong> Expression of Interest </strong> followed by <strong> an invitation to submit a Detailed Proposal.</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Expression of Interest should be submitted to us (by email to <a href="mailto:philwood44@live.com">philwood44@live.com</a>) 
            by <strong>17.00 BST on Friday 14 June.</strong>
        </p>
