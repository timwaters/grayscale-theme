      <img src="/img/rte-interview.jpg" width="240px" />
      <p>
       
        The Irish national radio stationâ€™s RTE 1  Inside Culture show featured the World Congress, interviewing a number of participants and covering a wide range of things, amongst a rather good show about Psychogeography in general.  If you were at the Congress you might have met and chatted with Regan. Sonia Overall, Morag Rose, Gareth Rees, Kevin Boniface and Barbara Lounder were featured,  as well as the voices of Graeme Murrell and Dave Smith are heard.
