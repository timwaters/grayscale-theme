            <h2>What is Psychogeography?</h2>
            <p>
                Psychogeography is a way of walking, (you may hear the terms derive or drift) which is a creative and playful way of travelling around by foot. This is different to a casual walk or a stroll because the aim is to explore places using ideas and chance
                or spur-of-the-moment decisions.<br /> 
                Psychogeography is a the way a place affects people.<br /> 
                Psychogeography can tell you more about yourself and how you use the spaces around you, it can tell you about the places themselves, and it might also be able to tell us how places that we thought we knew actually work.
