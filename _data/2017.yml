  - title: The Fundamentals of the Psychogeographical Method
    by: Fenella Brandenberg and David Bollinger
    location: Auditorium
    time: 10.45
    description: "Bollinger and Brandenberg are world leading psychogeographers and in this key-note talk they will take you on a grand tour of what psychogeography is all about and will explain how to go about creating your own psychogeographical adventures. <br />
    They will also be promoting their new book, The Fundamentals of the Psychogeographical Method, which will be published by Dodo Press in 2018. Their soon to be published book has received outstanding positive reviews from well-known psychogeographers such as Luther Blissett, ‘this book will change your life!’, Victor Salamanca describing the book as ‘a journey into the heart of darkness and a fascinating snapshot of who we are, lit by Bollinger and Brandenburg’s vivid prose. I’m sure that it will be read in a thousand years from now’ and also Rudolf Rudenski commenting that ‘Psychogeography is in crisis. Anyone that calls themselves a psychogeographer is actually a pseudo-psychogeographer. Bollinger and Brandenburg show us how to carve a path through the crap of psychogeography and they boldly point the way to a new way of doing psychogeography foregrounding an agenda for social change and action’."

    by: Brendan Bootland, Suzanne Elliot and Nick Hartley
    location: Auditorium
    time: "11.15"
    description: "In 2015, a group of psychologists led by Dr Ste Weatherhead walked the 100 miles from the British Psychological Society offices in Leicester to the branch office in London.  Stopping at food banks, hostels and charities along the way, the aim was to raise awareness of the impact of social policies on mental health with a specific focus on food poverty, homelessness and the benefits system. Suzanne Elliott and Nick Hartley joined with the group for part of the walk.  They describe the reasons for psychologists getting involved with such projects, and discuss the tradition of community psychology from which projects like these have developed.  Suzanne, who works for a homeless mental health service in Leicester, also draws on her work experiences to further raise awareness of issues around homelessness in the UK.  Reflections on the impact of the walk and the changes in attitudes towards homelessness will also be given by Brendan who has his own lived experience of sleeping rough in Leeds."

  - title: Short Personal Heritage Walks
    by: Graeme Murrell
    location: Outside
    time: "12.00 - 12.45"
    description: "This idea is a response both to Phil Smith's appeal at last year's 4th World Congress for inclusive derives which are accessible to those who may find it difficult to take part in the long meanderings characteristic of most flaneur activity,and to the request for activities which subvert the concept of heritage. <br />
    This will be a short 15 minute derive involving no more than 15 participants. It will follow a zigzag route away from the source followed by a direct return to the source. Each day's derive will begin at a different source. At each point where the derive changes course, a participant will be asked to share something short (a historical or architectural reference, random thought, sweets, personal reminiscence or something else in response to the space we find ourselves in). <br />
    The heritage exposed will therefore be shared and directionless, an overlapping narrative determined by the personal experiences and desires of the participants. Unlike a guided walk the narrative is most likely to be fractured and unexpected, and is unlikely to address any particular theme unless the participants sculpt one during their brief period together."

  - title: "Smells of the city: Scent, modernity and psychogeographical perspectives"
    by: Witold Van Ratingen
    location: Auditorium & then outside
    time: 12.45
    description: "Urban smells have a bad rep: typically the first to come to mind are the stench of urine, garbage, and smog. Given the medical dangers of unsanitary urban odours, it comes as no surprise that cities since modernity have viewed their own deodorization as a public responsibility. Our liberal use of chemical air fresheners, strict zoning laws, and rigorous hygiene regulations come, however, at a steep price; after all, the scents we grow up with are inextricably interwoven with our deepest memories and collective cultural identity. Smell walks have emerged as a means for urban dwellers to reacquaint and re-sensitise themselves with the most under-appreciated sensuous delight that the city can offer. Perhaps such walks could serve as a form of psychogeographic activism, in an attempt to restore lost olfactory identity to our cities. This talk will offer a brief history of urban smells and their disappearance, as well as providing a simple theoretical framework to think about environmental smells. Subsequently, we will embark on a collective 'smell walk,' following our noses to re-inscribe lost meanings and memories upon Huddersfield."

  - title: "Walking the walk: Can psychogeography save the world?"
    by: Morag Rose
    location: Auditorium
    time: 13.45
    description: "What is the point of getting lost in the contemporary city? This provocative talk will question the relevance of psychogeography today and ask what difference creative walking can really make within the all-encompassing spectacle. In the past Morag has claimed that “the dérive has the potential to transform the everyday, to illuminate and challenge narratives of privatisation, commodification and securitization of space, and navigate increasingly blurred boundaries between public/private” but what difference does it really make? Can psychogeography actually bring any useful tools, tactics and lessons to radical struggles or has its political potential been entirely neutered by commodification and recuperation? These questions will be explored through field notes and reflections from many years on the psychogeographical frontline."

    by: Annie Watson
    location: Auditorium
    time: 14.45
    description: "SOLAR is a collaborative arts and technology project that maps the solar system across the city of Sheffield, England, to the nearby Peak District through a series of specially commissioned artworks and a related walking app: <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/solarwalksheffield/id1210937903?mt=8'>available on Itunes</a>. <br />
    Our intention is to collaborate with an international academic community, using this app as a tool to map unique walks in other countries and cities. The SOLAR app allows individual or curated artworks to be embedded for each location, so each SOLAR walk would be bespoke. We envisage that sound, music or text could be commissioned for each planet. The eight planets of our solar system were assigned to a geographical location at a distance from the centre of Sheffield (the sun) representing the relative orbit of the planet and measured at a scale where the average walking speed represents the speed of light.<br />
    Participants enjoyed the gamification of finding the planets, and downloading the artwork, exploring parts of the city they had previously not walked around, and the experience of walking the distances between the planets. Neptune is so far away!"

  - title: "Walking Over Edges: A Personal Embodied Practice Experience"
    by: Ursula Troche
    location: Auditorium
    time: 15.45
    description: "Over the years I have come to realize that I am, increasingly, practising psychogeographic walking. It echoes and mirrors in the landscape, what I do in my work as an artist (and migrant): in poetry and photography, performance. My art-work is not ordinary work, ‘not a proper job’, not accounting, factory work, intangible.  And here psychogeographic terrain comes in: doing something, going somewhere beyond proper definition, causing consternation to the (anti) social (divisive) set-up. Walking/work here means going over edges of ready-made definitions, imaginations, concepts, assumptions. In (quasi-postcolonial) refusal of mimicry (Bhaba), it is about dropping repetitions and finding new spaces, new texts, new signs and symbols. Like entropy in communication theory (Shannon, 1948) and moving ‘from work to text’ (Barthes). Like embodying the Id in psychoanalytic theory: the walking id: I am walking, id is walking! Taking up the space of the unconscious in reverse:  I, the walker, am the unconscious to society, but conscious to myself. <br />
    In my presentation (with poetry and photos), I like to talk about/discuss the challenges and (social) opportunities of engaging in this practice which eludes popular definition relating to, e.g.: positive provocation/irritation, nature-writing, psychotherapy, (non-dualistic) revolution."

  - title: New Spectacle, New Drift, New Psyche
    by: Phil Smith
    location: Auditorium
    time: 16.45
    description: "Through the political spasms of the last year, clumsy expressions of deep rhythms of change, a new kind of Spectacle is emerging from its old ‘integrated’ form into a new meshwork of ‘post-truths’. This trend to vaporisation is thinning the relationships between different landscapes (including rural and urban) - and the jellies are coming!! In this presentation I will attempt to describe how psychogeographers can draw on the tensions within such changes and exploit them for their own ‘drifts’, arming their bodies in transit. I will describe a ‘war on subjectivity’, the opportunities for walking in the ripples of atomic suburbs and a new kind of dérive for developing a resistant psyche, adapted to the conditions of the ‘war’. I will conclude with a few findings from my recent ‘Anywhere’ project about how we can use the abandoned ruins of New Babylon curled up inside hidden dimensions of the hypermodern city."

  - title: Psychogeography Of The Fourth World
    by: Roy Bayfield
    location: Auditorium
    time: 17.45
    description: "The Fourth World is a fictional entity that has featured in a range of comic books and associated media since its creation in the 1970s by Jack Kirby, ‘the William Blake of comics’ (Grant Morrison).  In series such as ‘The New Gods’ and ‘The Forever People’ this mythical ‘world’ intersected with our own, in powerful and, arguably, prophetic illustrated narratives.  As a teenage boy Roy Bayfield would undertake lengthy walks to seek out these comic books and the irruptions of the numinous they could cause. Having recreated these walks using techniques from his book ‘Desire paths: real walks to nonreal places’, Roy will provide an experiential account of the Fourth World as it manifests today in the mundane reality of South Coast streets."

    by: Ally Standing & Gavin Rogers
    location: Auditorium 
    time: "12.00"
    description: "'In a dérive, one or more persons, during a certain period, drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there.' (Debord, 1956) Despite being over 50 years old, this quote from Guy Debord’s Theory of the Dérive has a certain contemporary familiarity - substitute ‘In a dérive’ for ‘When browsing’, and this would serve as an appropriate description of the kind of (often idle)Internet surfing which most of us engage in on a daily basis. <br />
    In a performative lecture touching upon various facets of life in the digital age - such as social media, augmented reality, and web mapping services - we will explore psychogeography in the age of the app, considering the rise (and fall) of the cyberflâneur, and whether or not certain recent technological advancements have changed what it means to explore."

    description: "Find the centre! Is there a correlation between the Town centre and the healthy mental state of being centred? Are you fed up with always working on the margins and at the edgy, liminal spaces? Do you wish to look inwards and find a stable centre? Participants on this walk will form into small groups of 3 or 4 based on their personality types - extraverts, intuitives and logicians. Extraverts would be encouraged to ask many people outside where the centre is for them and the walk there. Intuitives are asked to feel where the centre is, possibly finding genii loci or energetic places. Logicians, indoors initially, will use paper maps and computers to find the centre and optionally head out to find what its like."

  - title: "A Dérive around Huddersfield"
    by: Alec Shepley & Paul Jones
    location: Outside & Break-out Room
    time: "13.00"
    description: "UK artists Shepley and Jones will take as their starting point Michael Philipson’s provocation to uncover those spaces that culture has not reached and to take Philipson further, to excavate those spaces or gaps that culture has somehow forgotten or that progress has left behind. Through the everyday practice walking, Shepley will sweep-trace the ‘ley-lines’ left by architects and urban planners, and Jones will conduct data-collection experiments. <br />
    Through tracing and sweeping they will contour urban features, cracks and gaps, delineations and boundaries, exploring differences in the infrastructure precipitated by utopian and dystopian templates, and in-so-doing expose something between art and life - even if only momentarily. Data sweep drawings are often by-products of this process and the artists would hope to produce some for the Congress as a record of their dérives. <br />
    They propose starting from Heritage Quay, with a group of up to 20 to join, and then proceed – drifting through a district of the city. The walk will last one hour (within a two-hour slot) allowing time for introductions, the walk, and then discussion."

  - title: "Kick It Wicked: Graffiti as cultural history and terror in Philadelphia" 
    by: Tyson Mitman
    location: Auditorium 
    time: "14.00"
    description: "In the global graffiti era, where images are shared instantaneously, places that can keep their specific styles are a rarity. These places hold tightly to their stylistic traditions and imbue them with a great deal of the subculture’s local history, collective memory, and culture. New York City claims the Broadway elegant handstyle as its own. Sao Paulo, has a unique graffiti style called pixação. And Philadelphia has the wicked. Philadelphia writers say that there is no more original, important, esoteric or Philadelphia-specific graffiti style than Philly wickeds. Wickeds are very complex tags that often said to look like “scribble scrabble” to the uninitiated. But for those who can decipher them they are a form of cultural terroir. They are combinations of the elements of style that previous generations of writers have worked to create and they represent a dedication to style and craft that is found nowhere else in the graffiti world. This talk will help to demystify these tags, and explain their history and their cultural value and development. It will also explain why graffiti writers, who are enamoured with the idea of “fame” and recognition, dedicate so much time and effort into learning a style that is often illegible and indiscernible to the majority of the population. The talk will conclude with a short walk along the Huddersfield Canal to observe local graffiti."

    by: Andrea Capstick
    location: Auditorium
    time: "14.30"
    description: "This talk contrasts an ‘official’ guided tour of Graz, Austria in April 2017 with an informal derive along the banks of its river, the Mur, the same day. The former, an orthodox history of the city - the birthplace of Arnold Schwarzenegger and traditional stamping ground of the Habsburg monarchs – had been subjected to a typical form of narrative smoothing which elides less comfortable truths. The latter took in the remains of the former POW-turned-death camp Graz-Liebenau; a children’s playground in an area populated by economic migrants and asylum seekers which now occupies the same site; the Puchsteg bridge, built by forced labour in 1942, and a current protest camp against a proposed hydro-electric dam. The presentation will consist of photographs, associated musings and ramblings, and the occasional random fact."

  - title: Chasing The Whale
    by: Gopal Dutta
    location: Break-out Room
    time: "15.00"
    description: "“Whale” is a graffiti artist active in Manchester. I do not know the artist. I have seen his/her/their work on my walk to work. The graffiti is a simple “tag”, in the shape of a whale, which varies greatly in size, colour and design. See <a href='https://www.instagram.com/7urn7up/'>examples of 'Whale' </a> <br /> I will present a slideshow of different sightings of “Whale”, with a map indicating locations. I will show whales which are now “extinct” – painted over by other graffiti artists or Construction / development officials. The presentation will explore:  “Tagging” and the prolific nature of “Whale” across a specific area in Manchester. The anthromorphic and elastic nature of Whale as differentiating aspects with regard to other graffiti. Graffiti as an active questioning, an alternative means of orientation. It affords a new imagination of the City. Graffiti as 'political' / 'protest' etc. I'll present other examples of graffiti and street art in Manchester, to show the range and where whale fits, as I see it. I'll draw on some literature for this part of the talk. “Whale” in relation to the novel Moby-Dick. Upper Chorlton Road as the Pacific Ocean. Whale’s possible extinction? Myself as a topsy-turvy Ahab? <br /> 
    There will also be a couple of activities: Participants will be encouraged to draw their own whales using a range of different pens and mark-making instruments, on a range of different surfaces (paper / card / glass / metal) Participants will be invited to share their own stories about memorable graffiti from their own towns and cities."

  - title: Back on the map or a clean sweep? An EU migrant trailing enemy aliens in Yorkshire during the centenary years
    by: Claudia Sternberg
    location: Auditorium
    time: "15.30"
    description: "In this illustrated talk, I introduce and provide the rationale for a heritage trail to be launched on location in Lofthouse, West Yorkshire, during the 2017 Heritage Open Days. The trail has a World War One theme: it starts at the commemorative patch outside Outwood Memorial Hall, straddles along the site of a former internment camp for German and Austrian civilians and terminates at Rothwell Cemetery. <br />
    The trail makes reference to people, places and events from the first two decades of the 20th century. Additionally, however, I chart my own mappings and counter-mappings which connect past and present, national war memory and post-Referendum sensibilities. Inspiration comes from historiography, walks and encounters as well as psychogeographical concepts and Shaun Levin’s writing maps. In my reflection on vanished sites and perceived presences, I also comment on ‘the camp’, this transient non-place that always complicates palimpsestic narratives."

    time: "16.00"
    description: "Chain store car parks dominate our urban areas. Many assume that they are ‘non-places’, but for two years I’ve been walking around car parks and never found one the same. History, culture and topography leach into the car park. There’s public art, as well as unofficial public art (graffiti, posters, stickers). Car parks are used for unofficial activities, skateboarding, car stunts, drug dealing, dogging. They are also hotspots for crime, violence, mugging and sexual deviancy. Despite being heavily monitored private areas they are a blind spot in which activities go unnoticed.  <br />
    My walk will take people through two car parks, looking for unusual features, illicit human activity, strange markings, hints of history and topography. I’ll begin with a presentation about my ideas regarding car parks, and a reading of one of my car park investigations, so that attendees can get an idea of what they need to be looking for and thinking about. At the end of the walk we can share notes and discuss what we’ve seen and felt.

  - title: "I'm the City of Other Who Are The City - a participatory urban pilgrimage"
    by: Elia Rita
    location: Outside
    time: "16.00"
    description: "An urban pilgrimage will be performed in Huddersfield as an act of worship to the urban landscape and its inhabitants, turning it into a sacred site for a short period of time. The simple act of walking is chosen for its ability to be a non-violent method of reclamation and activation of the public space. Space that conforms our individual and shared identities, proved to be essential for democracy. Space, therefore, to preserve and question. <br />
    The action consists of a series of repeated movements that will be done in silence, as it requires a heightened consciousness of the space and circumstances around oneself. These will be taught to the audience during the introduction. <br />
    Eastern spiritual practices have informed this performance; a foreign cultural heritage has been studied with the acknowledgment that a form of appropriation is likely to be playing part in this work. Its original spiritual purposes are broadened to become aesthetic and political, but if it enters the art market, this intangible heritage will be inevitably commodified. As a result, its message will be shared with a wider audience, bringing awareness of the loss of public space and the accelerated pace of living that individualizes our community decisions, but can also mute that message.<br />
    TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS EVENT you are encouraged to bring along:<br />
    White pants and t-shirt/ sweater. <br />

  - title: Fragments For A City In Ruins
    by: Sara Rees
    location: Auditorium
    time: "16.30"
    description: "Set in contemporary Athens, Fragments For A City In Ruins is an essay film composed of photographic images and narrated fragments of text written by W.G. Sebald, Walter Benjamin, and Italo Calvino. Exploring themes such as memory, history, civilization and destruction, the work of these writers is profoundly informed by their experiences of fascism, Nazism and the Second World War. The film re-imagines their writing within the current geopolitical context of Europe, tracing through the city of Athens the entwined histories of empire and ruins.<br />
    Using a Sebaldian juxtaposition of photographs and text, the film seeks to generate new and unexpected connections and resonances; between the past and the present, between colliding narratives and histories. As in Sebald’s work, the film’s narrator is a peripatetic wanderer, a figure who, in the context of the refugee crisis, evokes one of the most pressing issue of our current times. Weaving together textual fragments, the film seeks to challenge the monolith of hegemonic historical narrative, proposing instead a poly-focal and multi-vocal perspective of memory and history.<br />
    The presentation will include a screening of the film followed by a lecture exploring the work's political and conceptual concerns. "

And what terrible truth connects the destinations encountered on this walk? Open to all creative thinkers: ignorance of local history knowledge will be an advantage."

  - title: Short Personal Heritage Walks
    by: Graeme Murrell
    location: Outside
    time: "13.15"
    description: "This idea is a response both to Phil Smith's appeal at last year's 4th World Congress for inclusive derives which are accessible to those who may find it difficult to take part in the long meanderings characteristic of most flaneur activity,and to the request for activities which subvert the concept of heritage. <br />
    This will be a short 15 minute derive involving no more than 15 participants. It will follow a zigzag route away from the source followed by a direct return to the source. Each day's derive will begin at a different source. At each point where the derive changes course, a participant will be asked to share something short (a historical or architectural reference, random thought, sweets, personal reminiscence or something else in response to the space we find ourselves in). <br />
    The heritage exposed will therefore be shared and directionless, an overlapping narrative determined by the personal experiences and desires of the participants. Unlike a guided walk the narrative is most likely to be fractured and unexpected, and is unlikely to address any particular theme unless the participants sculpt one during their brief period together."

  - title: Co-operativinya Street Stalingrad
    by: Russell King
    location: IQ Gaming, 23 Byram St.
    time: "14.00"
    description: "This event uses a simple, easily learnable manual wargame to communicate the surroundings and mores/customs of another City and another time. In the two hours, participants will be guided through a play of the game in which they will explore the Cityscape in detail and interact with other participants. This session is for up to eight people, with even numbers preferred but not absolutely necessary. <br />
    The Battle of Stalingrad1 in 1942 was an iconic struggle. In this walking tour of the City set in 1942, participants will experience first-hand the life of infantry soldiers on the ground, the chief actors of the war. In 1973, Simulations Publications Incorporated2 of New York, New York published a commercial wargame called Sniper!3, notable in being a first serious dynamic portrayal of man-to-man combat. It presaged many now commonplace things: professional military simulations, role-playing and sports games, first person shoot-‘em-up computer games such as Grand Theft Auto, and medical and architectural simulations. Sniper! was a best-selling wargame designed by James F Dunnigan4 - a unique talent in military simulation. The mapboard oddly depicted buildings as trapezoids. <br />
    In the two hours, participants will sit around a map and be guided by the facilitator, who is an experienced teacher, wargamer and medical disaster simulator, through a play of the game in which they themselves will explore the Cityscape in detail and interact with the simulated environment and other participants. No previous wargaming experience is required. The task facing the participants is indeed to walk around the Co-operatvinya Street area, deal with what they find, and get home safely again, in the manner they wish."

  - title: "VAVILON: Solovki Islands"
    by: Riccardo Arena
    location: Main Room, S2R
    time: 14.15
    description: "The presentation will concern VAVILON, a project focused on the Solovki Islands, in the Russian White Sea, near the Arctic Circle. Through history the archipelago became a place of worship for the ancient nomadic populations, a realm of ascesis and mysticism, an orthodox sanctuary, and more recently the site of the first Soviet forced labour camps, Gulag. The Islands are at the same time witness to the utopias and the dystopias, battlefield of ideological wars and a place for redemption. The inputs for the artistic investigation were a travel experience on the Islands in 2013 and the study of the less renowned aspects of Russian culture. In particular the Russian Cosmism that represents a common ground of the totalitarian system and that characterized all the history of the Soviet spaceship program, aimed at pursuing immortality through the cosmic escape from the labyrinth of mortality."

Menstruation is hidden and shameful within western capitalism. It has strong negative connotations. By exploring menstruation in the city we can RESIST capitalist tactics. We can create radical social change with de-tournament: we can sabotage and re-appropriate signs through menstrual activism, or menarchy!

    description: "Does following chance or a rule give a better derive than wandering? Based on the success of Tim’s walk in last year’s programme, this year’s will work with much smaller groups (4 people max in each group). At the beginning the participants will be in one big group and will get an introduction to the psychogeographic theory behind algorithmic walking and be encouraged to write down on paper at least two 'algorithms'. These pieces of paper will be handed back in and then shuffled up and when the groups split up they will each take a sheet, and head outside. <br />
    When outside, the participants will follow the algorithms, taking around 10 minutes for each algorithm. If they run out of ideas they can make up their own on the spot. Walkers will make sure they have returned to the venue for a communal debriefing sharing insights and ideas."

  - title: Drift In-between
    by: Bridget Sheridan
    location: Main Room, S2R
    time: 16.45
    description: "Guy Debord’s concept of the drift offers a different way of engaging with space. He believes that a map can be a way of entering into a drift. There are, in fact, several ways one can enter into a drift. Many walking artists, such as Tim Knowles and his wind walks, have explored the playful use of the protocole. Could this be a way of leaving behind all of one’s habitual ways of walking in order to create an aesthetic experience (following the definition of John Dewey’s experience in art)? <br />
    As a walking artist, I have recently questioned the drift in walking art and its relationship to discovering a new territory. For a commissioned project, Drift With Me, I was asked to explore the territory of a small village in the South West of France and to interact with its habitants. Thus, I decided to wander round the streets and paths, hoping to find people who were willing to anticipate in the project. The constraint was for me to film the path and then, afterwards, to project the video of the moving landscape onto their hands creating. They would then get lost in their everyday territory. The potter’s bowls would be deformed, the weaver would accidentally go the wrong way. The drift had begun with me, and continued with the inhabitants of Bordes. <br />
    I believe that the projected image has a power of creating a territory of the in-between, that it can lead the walker into a drift. As screens of all sorts mislead us in the streets, billboards, signs and smartphones open up space, hence drawing us into the depths of the digital world before throwing us instantly back into our everyday life, I question how the projected image can affect our perception of walking."

The performance can be viewed as a whole although we also encourage listeners to just dip in for a brief period, we don't intend for a formal concert environment. <br />
    The piece will culminate in audience participation with various noise making devices being distributed amongst the audience who will then be lead out of the performance space to make a racket in the street.

    description: "People -focused ‘modes of experimental behaviour’ and drifts emphasizing unplanned, interpersonal encounters, interactions and transactions can create new possibilities for détournement and new situations where the affective impact of people and places combine and flow together in a shared aesthetic sense. <br />
    25 pockets of [...] is an interactive drift and social assemblage project I use to randomly journey through cityscapes via unplanned encounters, interactions and transactions. Participants give away to the project an object possession and write on a picture frame, directions for the next location and person, or 'pocket' to be visited in a particular city. The trail of referrals from person to person continues in any particular city until at least 25 objects from 25 referrals have been collected. The objects are later incorporated into a final, framed collage. <br />
    Participants in [25] Pockets of […] have included: museum curators, car salesmen, teachers, bankers, artists, musicians, baristas, retail workers, dog walkers, professors, street cleaners, a Dean of a cathedral, a BBC presenter, a homeless poet, a renowned violin virtuoso, ‘someone with a cold’, a 'six foot tall blonde woman', to name but a few. Instead of mapping out and arriving at a fixed definition of the pictorial or discursive identity and substance of a place, it is hoped that [25] Pockets of […] conveys the affective flavour of a city as a dynamic variation of interpersonal relations and transactions.

Research so far tends to highlight the gap between education and industry as the moment in which the gender divide increases. I am very interested in exploring this transition, as well as the little researched point of 're-entry' as an older woman into the industry. I am the UK national researcher for a pan-European report mapping where the female film directors are across Europe, due for completion in early 2016.
    As co-founder of Sheffield Hallam Media Arts Walking Research Group, my project is KNITWALKS. I knit as I walk, and the knitting becomes a map. I worked as a film editor for ten years, before directing music videos with London's INDEPENDENT agency. My promo for IMONSTER'S Daydream in Blue was nominated for Q Award's Video of the Year.

In 2016 The LRM celebrated their tenth birthday with a 3 month extravaganza at Peoples History Museum which included work from over 50 international artists. Morag’s PhD research focuses on psychogeographies, gender and public space and her mission has always been to create a psychogeography that is accessible, diverse and critically engaging.

Delving into new realities is possible in any place at any time; one’s presence there is all that is need. Her actions seek for poetic purposes and take place in the terrain of the absurd - where art does its best - where ethics and aesthetics aren’t constrained to the burdens of logic."

Conceptually driven, I work across mediums, including video, photography, performance, installation, intervention, writing, and relational art. Over the course of my practice a constellation of spatial themes has emerged, concerned with the politics and poetics of space, memory and history in relation to place, and ruins as a site of both trauma and transformation. Arising from this territory, and inextricably interwoven through it, are questions about the nature of time, liminality and subjectivity. Whilst I often present work within a gallery context, a vital strand of my practice is site-specific, creating artworks for a diverse range of sites, from bucolic woodlands to a derelict ex-Soviet power station. Responding as much to aspects of a given site as to contemporary global conditions, and often blurring the boundaries between reality and fiction, my work seeks to be both playful and provocative."

Beeves’ ambient work makes immersive use of everyday soundscapes, manipulating and complimenting the sounds that surround him. In their joint project, <a href='https://goo.gl/mDdgcU'>Sonic Vandalism</a>, ML-B and Beeves scour the streets of Huddersfield for objects and street furniture to re-purpose as musical instruments. <a href='http://kevinboniface.co.uk'>KevinBoniface.co.uk</a> "

  - name: Alec Shepley
    description: "Alec is Head of the School of Creative Arts and Professor of Contemporary Art Practice at Wrexham Glyndŵr University. Prior to his appointment at Wrexham Glyndŵr University in March 2016 he was Head of Lincoln School of Art & Design at the University of Lincoln. Alec’s individual and collaborative research has attracted funding from the Arts & Humanities Research Council, the British Council, the Arts Council of England and the Arts Council of Wales and his work has been exhibited widely, both nationally and internationally, with examples held in a number of public and private collections in north America, Europe and Asia. He has been an active participant in national and international artistic research seminars and conferences for several years and his individual and socio-collaborative art research has attracted funding from the Arts & Humanities Research Council, the British Council, the Arts Council of England and the Arts Council of Wales. Through extending the language of painting and sculpture his works become more a means of encounter rather than an end in themselves, providing a document of art as social engagement. Through intertwining reality and fiction,he produces improvised sites that are dialectically linked replies to one another within the wider field of action."
  
  - name: Paul Jones
    description: "Paul leads on performance, video, photography, digital media, sound, installation and socially engaged art practices. Paul’s work is based on geography as an epistemological structure visualised through performance, video, photography, sound and drawing. From balancing acts and attempted border leaps, antagonistic border greeting performances to flag waving, Paul’s practice is concerned with the political, cultural and social systems that govern territory. He works collaboratively with artist Guy Mayman as part of DATAMOSH, developing hallucinatory visuals and ritualistic performances that reanimate a large archive of visual material. As a process of exploration and data mining the work responds to an excess of visual and audio material through deconstruction and re-contextualisation. Paul has exhibited widely in the UK and internationally including g39, Cardiff; Motorcade Flash Parade, Bristol; AC Institute, New York; A.T.P Gallery, London and MOTI, Breda. Contributions to conferences and publications include ‘Croeso I Gymru /Welcome to England – Performing the Welsh/English Border’, Art and Geopolitical Borders conference, MMU; ‘Cerbyd as Project’, Numbers Publication, ‘Small Town Kids’, Dazed and Confused magazine."
