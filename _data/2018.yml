    description: "<br /><b>Alex J Bridger : Walking In Between The Margins: A Psychogeographical Study with LGBT people in The Kirklees Area. </b>
This talk will outline psychogeography as a way to document LGBT people’s experiences living in the Kirklees area. It extends psychogeographical work to not only consider consumer capitalism but to conceptualise a gender informed approach to doing psychogeography. Bridger undertook various walks with local people from across the LGBT spectrum, in order to explore memories, create art pieces to represent experiences of the area and to document ‘queerness’ in places. His team conducted psychogeographical walks in Huddersfield, Batley, Holmfirth and Manchester. Participants took photographs, drew DIY maps and wrote reflective accounts of the walks. The team is in the process of threading key themes from the photographs, audio and written accounts by the participants. They believe further psychogeographical work is needed to work with LGBT people to consider their standpoints in relation to consumer capitalism as well as to develop a feminist, queer and LGBT informed approach to psychogeographical research and practice.

<b>Anna Davidson : Diverse/Derives. </b>
There is something about anagrams. Maybe it’s the opportunity to diverge from a word’s linear reading and to derive other meanings from the constituent parts. For the Situationist International, the détournement – taking capitalist cultural imageries and symbols and rerouting or hijacking them – was a mode of resistance against the alienation wrought by capitalism through culture. This short
video-presentation asks what might happen if the psychogeographic walk is diverted into its own Vague Terrains? What haunted, queer, feminist, invisible, nonhuman, othered subjectivities, ways of moving and knowing are situated on the margins of the dérive itself? What stories emerge of the Colne valley from Marsden to Huddersfield when you decentre the singular, present, coherent, human walking subject as story-teller?
<br /><br />
<b>Lesley Wood : Exploring Hinterland. </b>
In May 2016 Wood walked solo from Leeds to Newcastle, traversing personal hinterland between present and past home cities, exploring themes of connection, separation, loss and change. The walk was an inquiry into how women inhabit space (perhaps public space is more often than not 'vague terrain' for women) and the dynamic interaction between a human subject and a beloved landscape, emotionally, politically and aesthetically. She walked a 'matri-line' linking four generations and four female members of family (the latest in a long line of 'Eleanors'). Hence, her walk was an exercise in feminist psychogeography, investigating how her gender, as well as her age (60-plus) and impairment (arthritic hip), framed her experience. It provoked an exploration of the concept of hinterland- defined variously as: ‘behind the land’ (from the German); or, the area from which resources are drawn; or, the area beyond what is visible or known- as a metaphor for women’s beleaguered subjectivity. In that respect she experienced the line travelled as the ground on which she stands, the space where she discovered who she is. This personal aspect was linked to consideration of the lives of other women, both past and present, and with stories of human impact embedded in the landscape.

  - title: "Different perspectives on a place: Holbeck, Leeds"
    by: Simon Bradley, Nadia Bertolini and Ioanni Delsante
    location: Break-Out Room
    time: "10.45"
    description: "<br><b>Simon Bradley : Feeling for the Void Within A Context of Regeneration. </b>
For over 10 years Bradley has been doing walking-based research and oral history in Holbeck, Leeds. The neighbourhood has undergone a series of dramatic social and material changes during that time, and although reconstruction is well underway now, abiding themes have been erasure and displacement. Major decline is within living memory, and his work has engaged with this materially through walking the area, and also via talking through interview. As an ambulant sound artist he reassembles this material within a range of interventions including audiowalks and multi-media events. Regeneration programmes include the creation and destruction of wastegrounds, leftover sites, Voids, non-places, terrain vague, and loose spaces. Tight control necessarily wavers, and a range of transgressive behaviours becomes possible. Psychogeography provides a useful set of tools in approaching these places, and the revolutionary potential envisaged by the Situationists becomes tantalisingly close as ‘spaces of refusal’ (Reece Jones, 2012) begin to emerge. His paper explores these themes in relation to his current practice of ‘Displacement Activities’, walking-based collaborative interventions focused on rooting out edges, boundaries and borders, testing the potentials and limitations of terrain vague.

<b>
Nadia Bertolino and Ioanni Delsante : Consciously Uncontrolled. Mapping Urban Spaces in Holbeck, Leeds. </b>
The presentation focuses on the potentialities of mapping urban spaces through the consciously uncontrolled action of walking, observing, recording a place which is unknown. In particular, Bertolino and Delsante first introduce a reflection about a particular technique to interpret Debord’s theory of dèrive as a qualitative tool for mapping the “unexpected”. In particular, the mapping technique as a critical application of Debord’s theory onto a real case study is discussed: how can the body be used as a recording device and what is the value of such experience to map the urban space? Holbeck, Leeds, has been selected as a case study. Built fragments (archipelagos) and ‘terrain vagues’ are co-existing in a post-urbanised area, awaiting for an alternative setting to become possible. Findings are consistent with further investigations in terms of urban morphology and critical urban theory."

  - title: Retail Environments as Vague Terrain
    by:  Andrew Taylor, Katrina Whitehead, Kasia Breska & Rob Lycett
    location: Outdoors followed by Break-out Room
    time: "12.15"
    description: "<br> <b>Andrew Taylor & Katrina Whitehead : Empty Shop Project 4.0: Re-Viewing Post-Industrial Consumer Culture. </b>
Empty spaces pervade our once rich and vibrant retail centres, increasingly marginalised businesses shut-up shop and uninspired consumers wander the town centre of Huddersfield disconnected from their culture as consumers and community. How our surroundings affect us is embodied and embedded in patterns of everyday experiences;“… the breathtakingly brilliant aesthetics of Apple’s spit and polished flagship store in the Big Apple or, conversely, the intuitive sense that a shopping centre is on the slide as discounters occupy space formerly reserved for consumer-captivating, upscale-oriented anchor tenants.” (Brown, 2016). Andrew Taylor and Katrina Whitehead are ecologically re-mapping the post-industrial consumer culture in and around the town centre of Huddersfield. Drawing on inspiration from their walks, they curate a shared vision of how town centres can be experienced through shared data, documents and community involvement. Re-viewing the subtle spatial codes and signals that surround us, we ask how we can re-connect the liminal retail spaces with the townspeople to collectively discover a way to create a new and novel vision to a place. Can our collective ideas make a difference to how we map space, notice and experience spaces and regenerate our retail social spaces?

<b>Kasia Breska : Murals As A Site Specific Intervention – Translating Qualities of Space Into Colours And Symbols. </b>
Kasia Breska works as a muralist and her work is deeply rooted in a site specific research of a place, linking many different dimensions, from the history to architectural and geographical qualities, to cultural and visual aspects. Coming from the background of environmental studies and then fine art, Breska joins both, concepts of habitat and visual language. In her work, she researches the site she paints as a habitat, an environment, where all elements of that space constitute a certain set of dynamics, perceptions, then eventually feelings and behaviours. For Breska, murals are powerful elements changing those dynamics and perceptions and working as an artist gives an incredible chance (and huge responsibility) to influence, shape the space. She works with an idea of developing systems of codes and shapes that create an alphabet, language of the space/location. The second element influencing her creative process is colour, vast quantities of flat, block colours, applied in carefully thought over combinations, joining the compositions of shapes and symbols. All designs Breska executes are there to build connection between the space and its inhabitants, to influence space’s qualities, to create a ‘good habitat’ for those who live/stay there.

<b>Rob Lycett : Qquivalent: VI {Vague Terrains}.  </b>
Alfred Stieglitz produced a body of photographic works within which he explored the notion that a photograph could become an equivalent. His subject was the sky. The Queensgate Market is remarkable for its roof and the way in which it is an abstraction of natural phenomena (light, clouds, rain, wind). This work explores the roof in its relationship with the landscape. Beginning with a derive (drift) through the market space, visual and textual experiences of the artist are used to create a database of records in the form of photographs ( = light, colour, movement) and texts ( = situationist manifestos, observations).

  - title: "Lunch break dérive: short personal heritage walks"
    by: Graeme Murrell
    location: Outside
    time: "13.00 & 13.15"
    description: "This idea is a response both to Phil Smith's appeal for inclusive derives which are accessible to those who may find it difficult to take part in the long meanderings characteristic of most flaneur activity, and to the request for activities which subvert the concept of heritage. This will be a short 15 minute derive involving no more than 15 participants. It will follow a zigzag route away from the source followed by a direct return to the source. Each day's derive will begin at a different source. At each point where the derive changes course, a participant will be asked to share something short (a historical or architectural reference, random thought, sweets, personal reminiscence or something else in response to the space we find ourselves in).  The heritage exposed will therefore be shared and directionless, an overlapping narrative determined by the personal experiences and desires of the participants. Unlike a guided walk the narrative is most likely to be fractured and unexpected, and is unlikely to address any particular theme unless the participants sculpt one during their brief period together."

    by: Tony Wade
    location: Auditorium
    time: "13.30"
    description: "In May June and July 2018 artist Tony Wade walked, documented and painted the entire length of the Wakefield District Boundary. The boundary is a 60-mile long line which appears on maps but has no objective reality on the ground. To paint it he split the boundary into 20 x 3 mile stages and found a place in the middle of each stage to paint. He painted on three panels (40cm x 20cm) recording what he saw in 180 degrees from horizon to horizon looking outwards from the district. The series of 60 paintings record a complete view from the boundary looking out. Along the way he interviewed people living near this space to find out what it means to them. All the work collected will form a unique exhibition and online resource."

The world probably doesn't need any more such techniques, but - nothing daunted – Boyle would like to propose some. If they have novelty, it is the scale, or abstraction level, at which they operate. They are easy to implement and 4WCoP delegates will be able to go outdoors and implement them immediately."

    by: Martin Eccles, David Sables and Kerry Hadley-Pryce
    location: Break-out Room
    time: "15.15"
    description: "<br />
    <b>Martin P Eccles : Trace No Trace. </b>
The presentation will describe the ideas within 'trace no trace' - a critical engagement with solitary movement through time-space. Resulting in a pair of installations utilising multi-channel sound and text, “No. 1: trace” took place inside and above Smallcleugh Level, a drift mine, in Nenthead; it examines walking in the context of a walk inside a lead mine and a second walk following the route of the underground passages on the fell above. 'No. 2: no trace' took place in the River Pont over the half mile where it flows inside the estate boundary of Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland; and examines walking in the context of two walks (on the winter solstice and on the spring equinox), each one upstream and downstream, along a common route, in a river. Using Ingold’s idea of the trace, the presentation will critically interrogate walking across the two sites and four walks. Suggesting the presence and absence of the walker’s trace and the impact on walking of profound disruption of the walker’s senses (vision, hearing, balance), it offers the opportunity to reflect on the nature of solitary walking in particular, walking in general across space-time and how these are influenced by terrain.
<br /><br />
<b>David Sables : Shadows On The Landscape. </b>
The presentation consist of a short talk and film showing a person moving through a mixed urban and rural landscape with sound references relating to a pivotal point in the subjects life and the emotions this journey evokes. The film and talk seeks to explore what is remembered and who decides what is remembered and how landscapes have been and are being reconstructed to eliminate cultural and working class memory reference points which are unpalatable to elites. The film was made as part of a Northern Film school Leeds Becket university project, called ‘Mining the Memories’ and is based on a poem Sables wrote some years ago based on memories of events during 1984/85 Miners’ Strike.

<b>Kerry Hadley-Pryce : Psychogeographic Flow in the Black Country. </b>
A talk about the link between Psychogeography and Flow theory and how this could inspire, enable or energise the production of a new piece of creative writing in the unmappable area known as the Black Country. This is about disrupting the assertion that psychogeographies (literary and physical) have, exclusively, cities at their centre and focuses on an area in the West Midlands known as the Black Country. As others have noted, the precise pinning down of where the Black Country borders are located has been, and remains, a contentious issue. It tends to be regarded as a liminal place, not quite town, not quite rural, yet containing both, and it is a ‘place’ that has dialects, traditions and a culture, which includes its literature/writing output. Indeed, an important thematic thread of writing that comes out of the Black Country is ‘place’ or, more specifically a sense of place. Those who live there have a form of topophilia without even realising it. By focusing on this notably ‘unmappable’ place (the Black Country), this talk takes psychogeography at its word, off the beaten track, drifting into an analysis of how writers deal with the region as a ‘sensation of place’ in their writing and will develop the concept of psychogeography further as a creative writing practice, connected to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s ‘Flow’ in creativity. Keeping in mind the definition of psychogeography as the nexus of consciousness and the physical environment as ‘read’ by the senses, of course, reveals the significance of placiality and spaciality on the psyche.

  - title: "Charles Conrad Abbott: Archaeologist, Naturalist, and New Jersey Psychogeographer"
    by: David Platt
    location: Auditorium
    time: "15.45"
    description: "New Jersey occupies a complex position in America’s cultural imagination. Most people think of the state’s sprawl, malls, factories, landfills, and Super Fund Clean Up sites; yet, it is officially named “The Garden State” for its farmlands and remaining “wild” areas. The state is a mishmash of land-use types—in constant flux, as locations fall in and out of use. It is an edgeland state. Charles Conrad Abbott (1843-1919) authored books based on his walking explorations of rural and semi-rural New Jersey. Most focus on his wildlife observations, but also articulate a profound awareness of the region’s palimpsest of historical landscapes. His accounts of watchful walking, deep historical knowledge, and ethical core (including grief at the displacement of the Leni Lenape people)—mark him out as America’s first psychogeographer. Platt locates Abbott’s work in the context of contemporary psychogeography as well as American traditions of geographical writing (e.g., American romanticism, Deep Mapping), and revisits some of the locations where he walked. Most importantly, Platt argues that we can still learn from his practices, nearly a hundred years after his death, and Platt explains how Abbott’s example has helped him, a transplant from the northwest of England, begin his own explorations of his adopted home."

    by: "Nazlı Tümerdem & Sevgi Türkkan"
    location:  Auditorium
    time: "17.00"
    description: "In October 2017, the independent research project Istanbul Walkabouts and ITU first-year architectural design studio intersections3400 organized a 9-km walk in northern Istanbul with 250 students. Unlike the urbanized, industrialized and populated southern part of the city, northern Istanbul is sparsely populated with houses, villages, forests, water reserves and agricultural lands. Currently, this region is going through massive transformations due to mega-projects imposed via top-down approaches. The walk aimed to critically explore this site while experimenting with the use of walking as a transformative tool for architectural learning. The presentation aims to reflect upon the twofold manifestation of “terrain vague” in this walk: geographical and pedagogical. The former refers to ‘vacant’ operational landscapes of the city where the walk was performed; and the latter refers to doubtful traditions of architectural pedagogy: reliance on aerial views, plans, maps, as well as dichotomies of built-natural, urban-rural etc. that confine the understanding and designing of environments. Ultimately, the outcomes of walking-learning in Vague Terrains will be discussed through student works; installations located in various parts of the city, manifesting a statement based on their experience.

    by: David Upton

    time: "17.15"
    description: "Last November Upton organised a derive in Waterloo station, London, at 6pm - the height of the rush hour. At this time, almost everyone on the station is rushing through, intent on reaching a precise spot just before the precise time when their next train leaves, or else standing still, waiting for something.They turned this on its head: they set a precise spot to reach, but agreed NOT to reach it before a distant time. As a result, they took 45 minutes to walk 70 yards. This surely qualifies as the shortest derive in history - in distance, at least. Roughly four feet a minute, or one short step every 30 seconds. (You mustn't stand still.) The idea was to impose their own time on their environment: to be in the station but in a different time space. "

    description: "The performance is inspired by a multi-sensory consideration of the railway as emergent terrain vague. Shifting spaces, times, sounds, visions, smells, and memories are invoked by a series of ritualised procedures involving chanting, performance poetry, dreamscapes, portable sonics, and storytelling transporting the audience deep into the intimate workings of The Network. Bradley and Troche build their performance upon a spectrum of observations, from close up and from afar. The train epitomises Debord’s ‘rapid passage through varied ambiences’ and yet it runs on tracks in a linear fashion, hence their specialised strand of linear dérive research comes to bear here as they explore curved spacetime, uncovering myriad folded t(er)rains, and connections activated by encounters with and across lines and borders, edging into realms of quantum entanglement hidden even from trainspotters, as hungry caterpillars munch their ways through the countryside, across rivers, tunnelating through hills, and under the sea! What might appear as solid and linear becomes extremely vague and intensely wiggly."

What lingering traces of Victor survive in the scene of his greatest moment? Did he leave behind evidence of what happened to him when he vanished? What if, just what if, he returned to the Colne Valley when he disappeared and lived out a life of peace and quiet, protected by his friends of ’07?

    description: "The labyrinth creates its own vague terrain: a sacred space in a secular setting; a treading out of inner journeys; a mapping of metaphor. Appearing puzzle-like and perilous, the labyrinth offers the prospect of becoming lost; yet by trusting the winding path, the walker's journey to the centre is guaranteed. Join walking textile artist Elspeth Penfold and psychogeographer Sonia Overall in an exploration of the labyrinth, a temporary vague terrain. Participants will be offered the opportunity to document their experience of walking the labyrinth through the knotting of handmade ropes. The ropes will be attached to a ‘vara’ or textile pole, which becomes a record of the walk. The mnemonic action of knotting ropes while negotiating the vague terrain of the labyrinth opens new possibilities of thinking creatively. Elspeth’s practice explores the relationship between walking, weaving and storytelling. Sonia’s research and teaching includes the use of labyrinths and other embodied approaches to creative writing."

    description:  "Davidson and Woodall will discuss what creates the feel of a place of Vague Terrain and find places in a dérive which have that sense. They will discuss the terms ‘therapeutic’ and ‘landscape’ in a way intended to release subjective definitions of both of them. This will be informed by, and might involve mentions of, Dutch landscape painting, felt sense and other types of body psychotherapy, and geographic notions of Edgelands, but will mainly be about leading participants to release a subjective definition of both. Participants will be asked to consider a frame which creates a gestalt around an element(s) of landscape , record and share their impressions of it in a way which celebrates its uniqueness, and the overflowing possibilities of our responses to it - historic, associative, contextual. creative, archeological and evocative. Helpful examples will be provided, and space will be offered for sharing the impressions of the experience."

    description: "New media sound performance, designed as a sound walk, which the spectator takes on a circular pre-delineated path and follows by means of a mobile app and headphones. With the help of sound images, imprinted into the location of the delineated path, she or he traverses between fictive and real situations. When one is walking a safe, known city path, one finds it hard to imagine that women in some parts of the world do not walk alone - that individual walking is connected with inappropriate, even illicit, behaviour. At this point, the mechanisms of control for safe walking of female individuals enter the picture, in the form of social regulations, which are, and will be in the near future, strengthened by the apparatuses of power, control and capital. Group collective walking, as a revolt and conquering of space, is a reflection of political action. What about individual walking? Can walking, as a personal and conscious choice, be the power of an individual? An intervention into the existing social system? Is it radical to walk? Walking as a possible means of resistance, so much more so when time and space are taken by a woman, a woman who has the social and self-regulating access to the time to walk."

    by: "Two Ruins - Jim Colquhoun and Steve Hollingsworth"
    location: Various locations around Marsden
    time: "19.30"
    description: "Two Ruins use a Classic Citroen CX (the embodiment of an obsolescent utopian gesamtskunstwerk), within which they perform amidst a lattice of red neon tubing arranged within the interior space of the vehicle. They invoke the indeterminacy of rotting places: old lock-ups, dead-end streets, post-industrial voids, gap-sites and scrubland. They want to inaugurate an ambiguous disjuncture through the combination of flesh and technology, the voyeuristic gaze of passers-by and the libidinal conjunction of futures past as they take the viewer on a journey with the body/car as stage set, as material and as sound. A specifically composed electro-acoustic piece will emanate from the vehicle during the performance, adding to the disjuncture and 'out of time' nature of the piece. The intention is to insert dissonant memories into the minds of viewers to initiate questions for which answers are ambiguous and determinant on subjectivity."
