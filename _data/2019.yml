  - title: The experiential landscape - the psychogeography of photography. 
    by:  Rob Knight
    location: Auditorium
    time: "11.00"
    description: "An interactive talk aiming to illuminate and explore the creative and reflective nature of psychogeography and how a creative artists may use it to inform and shape their work. 
    <br />
    The Experiential Landscape explores how many of our previous life experiences, skills, jobs, relationships and more affect and shape how we perceive the world around us and our place within. Using a psychogeographic mindset we can develop a reflective and creative knowledge of the places we inhabit and transition through. Asking questions of ourselves to understand our personal notions of space and place is a means to interact with and explore our environment. Rob uses the medium of photography, video, audio and written word to reflect on and tell the story of his own experiential landscape shaped by a psychogeographic mindset.
    <br />
    The talk offers some very practical and real explorations of how psyhogeography shapes our interactive and perception of space and place to develop personal creative output. It asks the audience to reflect on and discuss some key questions to make it a two way presentation and collaborative creation of knowledge and experience. "

    description: "This will be a live-stream broadcast of a walking performance which will take place in a chosen location within Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam, featuring Patrick’s ongoing journey, together with his red suitcase.
    <br />
    So far there have been episodes of No Holiday both recorded and live-streamed from Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Venice (during the 2017 Biennale) and Yorkshire. The walk represents a Sisyphean journey to an intended holiday that is never reached. Patrick pulls his red suitcase, map, selfie-stick etc. and attempts to experience the time spent travelling to the destination. 
    <br />
    He explores the everyday experience of travelling overseas, burdened with a suitcase, interested in anything and everything that is encountered along the way. The approach is passive and meditative. The walk provokes questions such as Where is the intended end to the journey? Will the walk ever end? What is in the suitcase? "

  - title: "An Antiquarian Psychogeography"
    by:  Mark Valentine & John Billingsley
    location: Auditorium
    time: "14.00"
    description: "Talk 1) Mark Valentine: A Country Still All Mystery – Occult Territory in Supernatural Fiction <br />
      This talk will survey examples of how writers in the ‘occult’ field have depicted ‘sacred’ or ‘sinister’ landscape, and will explore whether this has affinities with the practice of psychogeography.
      <br />
      W G Hoskins’ groundbreaking study The Making of the English Landscape (1955) explored how practical activities (agriculture, industry, etc) have shaped the land. But he was also alert to another sort of relationship, that of the numinous, marked not only by built shrines (churches, chapels) but also at natural places (springs, groves, stones). What has been left alone has a significance as well as what has been worked. 
      <br />
      This sense of ‘occult’ terrain is conveyed in a range of work in the supernatural or weird fiction field. Authors here evoke the uncanny both in remote country and in city streets. Arthur Machen’s ‘art of wandering’ and his alertness to strange experiences in the byways of London are already noted, but there are others whose work also portrays wanderers who encounter the weird: Mary Butts in Dorset and Cornwall; Elizabeth Bowen in the London of the Blitz; Walter de la Mare in several dream-like enclaves. The talk will also draw on insights in Amit Chaudhuri’s Clearing a Space (2008). <br /> <br />
      TALK 2) John Billingsley: Place-speak in the past (or something) <br />
      This talk will introduce and discuss a range of concepts:
      * The relevance of phenomenology in visioning the past and monuments in relation to their landscape and place; <br />
      * reconsidering the role of folklore, particularly place legends, as the psychogeography of previous generations and the making of communal cognitive maps; <br />
      * acknowledging Coverley's inclusion of antiquarian investigators like Alfred Watkins in the broader psychogeographical canon, and the impact notions such as ley lines have had on contemporary appreciations of place; and  <br />
      * ways in which a contemporary alt-antiquarian can intentionally project a mythopoetic enquiry on to mundane landscape."

  - title: Huddersfield Orbital
    by:  Tim Chapman
    location: Outside
    time: "14:00"
    description: "This walk will be a condensed détournement of Iain Sinclair’s popular psychogeographic classic London Orbital, diagnosing the state of the nation on a circular walk of something under two miles around Huddersfield Ring Road.
    <br />
    It will be a psychoeconomic exploration of the rise and fall of industrial civilisation. In the early 1960s, journalist James Morris looked down from Chapel Hill on a landscape of working mills, at the start of his book ‘The Road to Huddersfield: A Journey to Five Continents’. Commissioned by the World Bank, the book took Huddersfield as the epitome of industrialised society, an exemplar for the developing world to follow. Half a century later, Britain turns inwards. From the same point on Chapel Hill, we don’t take the road out into the world, but the circular ring road that carved out the town centre in the Harold Wilson era. The walk passes through Luddite insurrection, 19th century industrialisation and dissent, 20th century pride and decline, to examine the new landscape of student accommodation and premier football. Cultural highlights include King Arthur, the Sex Pistols, Stockhausen, James Bond, Little Malcolm, and the secret portal to Viriconium."

  - title: "The Psychogeography of Nuclear War and Peace"
    by:  Becky Alexis-Martin & Wesley Perriman & Malcolm Craig, Moderated by Phil Wood
    location: Auditorium
    time: "16:15"
    description: "Talk 1) Becky Alexis-Martin: Atomic Hol(e)y Spaces of Los Alamos  <Br />
      A talk about feminist and auto-ethnographic processes surrounding psychogeographical exploration of nuclear places and spaces, with a focus on Los Alamos.
      <Br />
      Los Alamos rose from obscurity, a secret city called “Project Y”, nestled in the canyons of New Mexico. It was to become infamous as the home of the atomic bomb, the source of the science and technology that propelled and detonated atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 6th and 9th August 1945. It is still a place of contradictions and secrets. It is a Plutopian idyll, presenting now as a pristine and beautiful town of white picket fences, surrounded by the dusty canyons of the New Mexican mesa. It makes a feature of its nuclear weapons laboratory. Tourist attractions include the Los Alamos visitor centre, LANL’s Bradbury Science Museum, Los Alamos Historical Museum, and Fuller Lodge Art Museum. These places retell the story of the atomic bomb, capitalising upon the culture of secrecy that surrounds nuclear weapons to rework the public-facing history of Los Alamos. 
      <Br />
      Becky will focus on the Church of High Technology, the Black Hole and the Doomsday Stones, and their role in creating places of subversion and peace within the nuclear military industrial establishment by “un-worshiping the bomb”.  <Br /> <Br />
      
      Talk 2) Wesley Perriman: Nuclear Family: Looking at the legacy of British Nuclear Testing. <br />
      Wesley will talk about his personal connection to Britain’s history of nuclear weapons testing – his father was a veteran. This will segue into the wider effects of the tests on their locations and the local populace. Finally Wesley will look at how our Nuclear heritage is being lost. Because the tests were conducted on the opposite side of the globe an 'out of sight, out of mind' mentality has developed.<br /><br />

      Talk 3) Malcolm Craig: Space and place in the history of nuclear proliferation <br />
      This talk will examine the ways in which policymakers, the media, and creators of popular culture have imagined the links between the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the geographical environment. From the popularisation of imagined territories to interconnections between the commonplace and the unusual, the complexity and occasional strangeness of the nuclear world will be explored, with particular reference to locations in the UK and Pakistan.

  - title: Post-psychogeography, or a theory of unwalking 
    by:  Ivan Pope
    location: Breakout Space
    time: "16:15"
    description: "Can we have a psychogeography without walking? 
    <br />
    Ivan says Psychogeography has become an 'ambulatory behemoth', fixated on walking as a methodology when it should be a means of interrogating landscape to generate texts. He speculates if it is possible to undertake walking without going for a walk. He suggests separating ‘the walk’ from the physical action of walking, which he calls ‘unwalking’. He propose the notion of a protocol stack, taken from communications technology, to understand the constituent parts of the unwalking
    <br />
    Ivan hopes that some of the counter-intuitive ideas he’s putting forward will shake up some fixed notions of what psychogeography can be by suggesting different substrates or modes of engaging with the landscape, different methods of recording, or disseminating, or choosing places."

  - title: Walking a Different Way 
    by:  Kate Morton
    location: Breakout Space
    time: "16.45"
    description: "What happens to our perception of the world around us if we are not moving through it on two feet but using a wheelchair? This short video presentation will challenge the assumptions of Psychogeography and give a new perspective on how our means of mobility affects our relationship to the environment.
    <br />
    Kate says Psychogeography forgets there is a body that walks, and how that body walks affects how we perceive our environment. The traditional narrative of walking performance casts the walker as male, unencumbered and non-disabled. How would a different kind of body, with different expressions of mobility change the nature of a walking performance? The way we physically travel through the landscape affects what we notice about it and influences our emotional response. Landscape is shaped by the way we use it, navigate it and by the events that have happened there and at the same time. We are shaped by the landscape we move through. We relate events to places and memories are situated in particular locations.
    <br />
    In relegating wheelchair use to a position other than walking, researchers, artists and psychogeographers are neglecting to discover the ways that different mobile practices might inform the whole debate about what walking is and what it means to walk. What if the rhythm of walking were different? How might that affect the rhythm of thought? Is it possible that the freedom to think comes not from the action of the feet, but from some other quality of human/landscape relationships?"

  - title: Psychogeography is Runsploring. Exploring Marsden by Running. 
    by:  Laura Williams
    location:  Breakout Space
    time: "17.15"
    description: "The countryside can be wild but traces of human existence can be found everywhere. Fences and walls, stiles and gates. Ruined farmhouses and dilapidated barns. Electric fences and litter. Laura will emphasise the rural landscape as an interesting site for psychogeography.
    <br />
    Ever since she started running Laura has used it as the way of exploring new places. Put on your trainers, leave the house and just start running without any fixed idea of route. Build a map in your mind through piecing together the landscape by running. Runsploring - running plus exploring is a form of psychogeography. 
    <br />
    Laura will talk about her psychogeographic explorations of Marsden, sharing stories of running on the paths, tracks, trails and moors around the village and beyond. She will challenge us to question and reconsider the definitions of psychogeography for a rural context; and explore whether running, rather than walking, can be considered a form of psychogeographic practice.

    time: "19.30"
    description: "Includes a screening of films by Ali McDonald <br /> 
    and <br />
    Morag Rose’s ‘Loitering, Loving and Getting Lost’ <br /> 
    This performance combines fieldnotes from over a decade of artist-activist-academic praxis with a new and more personal psychogeography.
    <br />
    In 2006 Morag co-founded The LRM (Loiterers Resistance Movement) a psychogeographical collective based in Manchester UK. Initially conceived as an experiment in taking radical political theory onto the streets, a key part of the work has been regular free, communal dérives, open to all who wish to wander and wonder on the First Sunday of every month. The LRMs manifesto states “We can’t agree on what psychogeography means” and we have a deep commitment to diversity, plurality and walking as an act of solidarity and defiance. At the heart of this is a the declaration that “ We believe there is magick in the mancunian rain. Our city is wonderful and made for more than shopping. The streets belong to everyone and we want to reclaim them for play and revolutionary fun...”
      <br />
    Walking beyond The LRM into a more personal quest, this year Morag has begun tracing the footsteps of her ancestors. This quest draws links between Morag’s fragmented memories and wider socio-political issues of gender, disability, community and commemoration. Her walking has become not just an act of resistance but of remembrance and personal discovery.
      <br />
    This work draws on, and expands, the extensive LRM archive, sharing highlights alongside new discoveries. It is a provocative performance blending – as all dérives do - poetry, politics and art, creating a work that is equal parts polemic, requiem and a manifesto for psychogeographic loitering.
