    by: Phil Smith
    location: Heritage Quay
    time: 4pm - 5pm
    description: What is the future for psychogeography? To open the Congress, Phil Smith will outline his proposal for a state of walking that explores the frontiers of human identity, ecology and much much more. Looking at some future shifts in contemporary psychogeography, Phil proposes a walking which is both quest and architecture that produces more in the way of totalities than fragments.

    time: 4pm - 6pm (105 mins)
