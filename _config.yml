  - title: Psychogeography Extreme
    by: Phil Smith
    location: Heritage Quay
    time: 4pm - 5pm
    description: What is the future for psychogeography? To open the Congress, Phil Smith, in this talk, proposes future shifts in contemporary Psychogeography for a walking that is both quest and architecture and against a ‘Spectacle’ that invades subjectivity and pixilates public space. Phil will argue for an ecological walking that acknowledges the malevolence of the planet’s molten centre, for the taking back of the surplus of pleasure, and for new ‘grounds’ for a politics of the anti-Spectacle where our entanglement with distant things changes the here and now

  - title: A Walk in the Park
    by: Travis Elborough
    location: Heritage Quay
    time: 7.30pm - 9pm
    description: Travis will present an illustrated, peripatetic survey of urban green space drawing on the material in his latest book <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1098877/a-walk-in-the-park/">A Walk in the Park</a> (just out in Penguin), described as ‘fascinating, informative, revelatory’ by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/18/a-walk-in-the-park-the-life-and-times-of-a-peoples-institution-travis-elborough-review">William Boyd in The Guardian</a>, and his research during a residency in Victoria Park in East London with the Chisenhale Gallery in 2014-5. With their origins in aristocratic hunting preserves. Elborough argues that public parks have often proffered tame wildness to tame the wildness of the urban poor. As such their histories are steeped in age-old battles over land and liberty, work and leisure, taste and class, while currently they stand imperilled by government austerity measures and the invidious privatisation of free public space. This talk is not to be missed!

    note: Before this event be sure to join Travis and come to Greenhead Park at 6pm for a walk led by David Griffiths author of "Secured for the Town- The Story of Huddersfield’s Greenhead Park".
