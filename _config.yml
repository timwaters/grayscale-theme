  - title: Psychogeography Extreme
    by: Phil Smith
    location: Heritage Quay
    time: 4pm - 5pm
    description: What is the future for psychogeography? To open the Congress, Phil Smith will outline his proposal for a state of walking that explores the frontiers of human identity, ecology and much much more. Looking at some future shifts in contemporary psychogeography, Phil proposes a walking which is both quest and architecture that produces more in the way of totalities than fragments.

  - title: Getting Lost on Purpose
    by: Tim Waters
    location: Start at Heritage Quay and then wherever 
    time: 4pm - 6pm
    description: Participants will devise unconventional rules and methods for walking (such as a flip of a coin or dice or following odd patterns), and then put them into practice around town. By getting lost on purpose we move across the streets in a way we haven't done before which can lead us to new insights about how we use the spaces and places we are in. We may get lost so let's see where you end up!
